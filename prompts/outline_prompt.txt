Example 1. Ancient Greek tragedy based upon the myth of Jason and Medea. Medea, a former princess and the wife of Jason, finds her position in the Greek world threatened as Jason leaves Medea for a Greek princess of Corinth. Medea takes vengeance on Jason by murdering his new wife as well as Medea's own two sons, after which she escapes to Athens. Medea is the protagonist of the play. A sorceress and a princess, she fled her country and family to live with Jason in Corinth, where they established a family of two children and gained a favorable reputation. Jason has divorced Medea and taken up with a new family. Jason can be considered the play's villain, though his evil stems more from weakness than strength. A former adventurer, Jason abandons his wife, Medea, in order to marry the beautiful young daughter of Creon, King of Corinth, and fuels Medea to a revenge. The Women of Corinth serve as a commentator to the action. They fully sympathizes with Medea's plight , excepting her decision to murder her own children. The King of Corinth Creon banishes Medea from the city. The Messenger appears only once in the play to bear tragical news. The Nurse is the caretaker of the house and of the children and serves as Medea's confidant. The Tutor of the children is a very minor character and mainly acts as a messenger. <scenes> <place>Medea's modest home</place> <element>Exposition</element> <beat>The Nurse recounts the chain of events that have turned Medea's world to enmity.
