There is a single small window covered in grime, providing the only source of light.', 'Car Wash': 'The car wash is a small, cramped space with fluorescent lights that flicker overhead. The sound of water spraying and machines whirring is constant. The smell of soap and cleaning chemicals fills the air. Customers impatiently wait in line, tapping their feet and checking their watches.', 'Various Drug Deals': 'A dimly lit alleyway with graffiti-covered walls, littered with empty drug bags and burnt out cigarettes.

There's a single window with the blinds pulled shut, casting the room in a dim, yellow light. The only furniture is a rickety bed, a battered armchair, and a small TV. The room smells of cigarette smoke and stale food.", 'White Residence': 'The White residence is a modest suburban house, with a small front yard and a driveway leading up to the garage. The exterior is in need of a fresh coat of paint, and the garden is overgrown and unkempt. Inside, the decor is outdated and cluttered, with a mismatched assortment of furniture and knick-knacks.'}
